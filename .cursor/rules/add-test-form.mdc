- If the HTML is not provided, ask the user to provide it.
- Create a file in the `test-forms` directory with the naming convention `<sitename>_<formtype>.html`, e.g. `instagram_login.html`.
- Add an entry to the `test-forms/index.json` file.
- Trim HTML based on `real-world-html-tests.md` file. Use only the subtype instead of the fully qualified type. E.g use `password.current` instead of `credentials.password.current`.
