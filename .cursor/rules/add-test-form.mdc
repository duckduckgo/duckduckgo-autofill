alwaysApply: false

- If the HTML is not provided, ask the user to provide it.
- Create a file in the `test-forms` directory with the naming convention `<sitename>_<formtype>.html`, e.g. `instagram_login.html`.
- Prettify using `node scripts/html-prettifier.mjs <input-file> <output-file>`
- Add an entry to the `test-forms/index.json` file, using `scripts/save-form-to-test-suite.js`
- Annotate the form's inputs and buttons, use examples from html files in `test-forms`. Use only the `subtype` instead of the fully qualified type. E.g use `password.current` instead of `credentials.password.current`.
