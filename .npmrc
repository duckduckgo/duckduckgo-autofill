# with jest-html-reporter which doesn't officially support Jest 30 yet.
# To see the specific peer dependency conflict, run:
# npm ls jest-html-reporter --peer
# Or to see all peer dependency conflicts that would occur without this setting:
# npm install --dry-run (after temporarily commenting out this line)
