**request example 1: email protection**

This occurs when a personal or private email was selected. (Not a form submission)...

```json
{
  "credentials": {
    "username": "abc@duck.com",
    "autogenerated": true
  },
  "trigger": "emailProtection"
}
```

...and then the following form submission would look like this:

```json
{
  "credentials": {
    "password": "abcd",
    "username": "0@duck.com",
    "autogenerated": true
  },
  "trigger": "formSubmission"
}
```

If the user changes the email value, then the `autogenerated` flag would be absent, eg:

```json
{
  "credentials": {
    "password": "abcd",
    "username": "dax@example.com"
  },
  "trigger": "formSubmission"
}
```
